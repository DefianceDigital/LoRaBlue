### Step 7: Decide whether to use "Text Mode" or "Audio Mode"  
Here we recieved a message from username "Brad". You can send messages just like you would a text message

### Step 8: If Audio Mode is desired, simply select it.  
To send a message, simply hold down on the microphone and speak. The app will convert this into text to be sent out. It is highly
resistant to noise, so it's perfect for a noisy truck. It also uses your phone's microphone and media output source rather than 
any connected headset, so it's independent of any call you may be in. When a message is recieved, it will convert the recieved 
text into audible speech and read it out loud to you. Whether you're using Text or Audio mode doesn't matter to other devices. 
They recieve messages in their preferred way. If you didn't quite understand a message recieved in Audio mode, you can switch to 
text mode and find it there. Once read, simply go back to Audio mode.
